Who Am I? I am Gabriel Baughman of course. While true I am also someone who likes to write about a lot of topics. These topics can vary from technology to politics to guides, to online privacy.
You can reach me via email, and find me on github.
I plan to write whenever I can because there are things I believe that should be known and I will make sure they are.</description></item><item><title>Building gabrielbaughman.xyz</title><link>https://gabrielbaughman.xyz/posts/11-21/building/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gabrielbaughman.xyz/posts/11-21/building/</guid><description>This is how I went about creating gabrielbaughman.xyz and how you can do the same.</description></item></channel></rss>

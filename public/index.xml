Who Am I? I am Gabriel Baughman of course. While true I am also someone who likes to write about a lot of topics. These topics can vary from technology to politics to guides, to online privacy.
You can reach me via email, and find me on github.
I plan to write whenever I can because there are things I believe that should be known and I will make sure they are.</description>

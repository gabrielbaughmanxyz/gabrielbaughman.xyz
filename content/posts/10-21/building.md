## Why should you care?
Well, having a website is cool and awesome.

# Getting Started
There are a lot of different ways you can create a website, but the way I did it is probably cheaper and more hands on. So, if this isn't what you are looking for then I suggest you look elsewere.

Here is what required to run a site: 
* Domain name
* Server or hardware to host on
* Software to run the site
* Creating the site

## 1. Domain Name
Some of you might not know what a domain name is, so I will explain it briefly.
A domain name is an alphabetic string that references an actual IP address. e.g example.com -> 192.123.456.789

I use [Epik](https://www.epik.com) to register mine, however there are other registers you can use.

## 2. Hosting
Once you have obtained your desired domain name you are going to want to have a place to host your site.
You can either use a VPS provider to host on, or use your own hardware and internet. Both have their benefits and downsides, but VPS hosting takes the responsibility of having hardware and good internet away so that is the one I chose. 

For my provider I went with [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8966022-8H) (My referral code gives you $100 and me $35 credit, which helps me keep posting) and chose the the bare minimum instance which is all you really need to host a basic site.

From there click **"Deploy New Server"**

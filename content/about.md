# Who Am I?
I am Gabriel Baughman of course. While true I am also someone who likes to write about a lot of topics. These topics can vary from technology to politics to guides, to online privacy.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:gabriel@gabrielbaughman.xyz), and find me on [github](https://github.com/gabrielbaughmanxyz/).

I plan to write whenever I can because there are things I believe that should be known and I will make sure they are. However, I have life that is busy so the times I post will vary.

# Values
I have some beliefs about online privacy and rights, along with individual rights.
There will not be any trackers, invasive anayltics, nor any advertisements on my site. I will not beg for donations, but I greatly appreciate them.
I will right about political topics that will represent my views, however I harbor no ill to those who have opposing views.

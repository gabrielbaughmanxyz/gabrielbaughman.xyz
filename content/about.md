# Purpose
I like to write about a lot of topics. These topics can vary from technology to politics to guides, to online privacy. I don't know if many people will see what I write, but I am not writing hoping to get lots of views, likes, or shares on social media.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:gabriel@gabrielbaughman.xyz), and find me on [github](https://github.com/gabrielbaughmanxyz/).

I plan to write whenever I can however, I have life that is busy so the times I post will vary.

# Values
I have some beliefs about online privacy and rights, along with individual rights.
There will not be any trackers, invasive anayltics, nor any advertisements on my site. I will not beg for donations, but I greatly appreciate them.

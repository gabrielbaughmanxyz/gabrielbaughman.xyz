# Purpose
I want to write regarding various subjects, but I wanted to have my own platform to articulate on. So, after considering the options that lay before me, I started my own site.

I don't know if many people will see what I write, but I am not doing this hoping to become renowned in writing.

# Values
I have a passionate belief in online privacy. There will not be any advertisements, trackers, or invasive analytics on my site. 

I do not require donations, but I will be grateful to any that comes my way.
